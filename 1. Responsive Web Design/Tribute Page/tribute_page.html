This course studied Gödel’s incompleteness results and Hilbert‘s question on decidability: given a mathematical proposition could one find an algorithm which would decide if the proposition was true or false? He learnt that Hilbert’s Entsceidungsproblem (decision problem) was still open. Turing was motivated by Gödel’s work to seek an algorithmic method of determining whether any given propositions were undecidable, with the ultimate goal of eliminating them from mathematics.</th>

This was an idealised computing device that is capable of performing any mathematical computation that can be represented as an algorithm. There cannot exist any universal method of decision and, hence, mathematics will always contain undecidable (as opposed to unknown) propositions.</th>

He then returned to England and accepted a renewed fellowship at King’s College. From September 1938, Turing had been working part-time with the Government Code and Cypher School (GCCS), the British code breaking organisation. He concentrated on Cryptanalysis of the Enigma, with Dilly Knox, a senior GCCS codebreaker.</th>

There he works with Gordon Welchman to develop the Bombe, a device for decrypting the messages sent by Germans using their Enigma machines. He then conceptualises a programmable computer; named Colossus, the first such machine is built 3 years later, based on his ideas. These machines were the predecessors to the first digital computers.</th>
